# Movies
This is my repository for for the movie mini-project.

# What was completed
-All required steps: Loading data from a db, computation of top 10 genres, computation of top 10 actors, and unit tests.  
-The first bonus question: Find best actor/director pairs

# Assumptions
*Profit of each film was calculated by gross minus budget 
*I was a little unclear about actor/director pairs. I decided an actor/director pair could be any pair of actor/director that have done 1 or more movies together.  
**For example if a director (D1) has done 3 movies with 3 different actors (A1, A2, A3) and their respective IMBD scores are 98, 87, and 75. Then I would return D1 & A1, D1 & A2, and D1 & A3 in that order if those were the only people/movies in the database.
